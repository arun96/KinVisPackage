# KinVisPackage
This is the R Package for KinVis Application.

Download the "KinVis" folder, run "install("KinVis")" in the parent directory to install the package (any necessary packages will also be downloaded and installed), then run "library(KinVis)" to attach the package.

Alternatively, you can download the package using the "install_github()" command, from Hadley Wickham's "devtools" package. To do this, simply run "install_github("arun96/KinVisPackage", subdir="KinVis")", and then attach the package as specified above.

To launch the application, please run "runKinVis("DataPath")", where "DataPath" is the absolute path to the folder containing the data to be visualized.
